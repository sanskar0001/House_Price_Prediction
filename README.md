# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices using various features such as location, size, and other relevant factors.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for estimating house prices based on historical data. By analyzing patterns in the dataset, the model aims to provide accurate price predictions that can be useful for real estate professionals and buyers.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset used for this project is sourced from [provide source if available].
- **Features**: Includes details such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and more.
- **Target Variable**: House price.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and insights in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Comparing multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
5. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate performance.

## Results

The final model achieved [insert performance metrics] on the test dataset. Key findings include:
- Feature importance rankings.
- Insights derived from EDA.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and results.
